        <h2>What is VLOG?</h2>
        <h3>
		VLOG is short for "video blog" or "video log". 
		</h3>
		<p>It describes a video format in which creators talk directly into the camera about a topic of their choosing or document events or activities they're involved with for their audience.</p>
		<p>While this defines vlogs fairly concisely, many vloggers take the format in new directions, and you don't have to feel confined by any specific format. 
		Provided you make regular videos on a topic that interests you, including but far from limited to your own daily life or pursuit of your hobby, you are a vlogger of some description. </p>
		<p>Vlogs are often personal, but this doesn't necessarily have to be the case.</p>

        <h2>Why VLOG?</h2>
		<p>VLOG is a way to record my life. I also enjoy the process of cutting videos. </p>
